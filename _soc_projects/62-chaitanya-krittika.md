Develop a Django website for Krittika

<!--break-->

We’re working to create a django website for catering to the publicity of events and handling of resources. We’re planning to expand the website to create a user friendly interface to edit the website with access given to specific people and create wiki. The other being handling user profiles and discussion forums.

There will be three steps that need to be followed. 
1. Design the skeleton for the website using basic CSS and HTML. Convert this into a mobile friendly django website.
2. Add the user profile features and create personalized views for short scale users.
3. Create user friendly interface to edit things on the website.
