<p>Develop a Django website for Krittika</p>

<!--break-->

<p>We’re working to create a django website for catering to the publicity of events and handling of resources. We’re planning to expand the website to create a user friendly interface to edit the website with access given to specific people and create wiki. The other being handling user profiles and discussion forums.</p>

<p>There will be three steps that need to be followed.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Design the skeleton for the website using basic CSS and HTML. Convert this into a mobile friendly django website.</li>
  <li>Add the user profile features and create personalized views for short scale users.</li>
  <li>Create user friendly interface to edit things on the website.</li>
</ol>
