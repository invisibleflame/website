<p>Producing 2D images of a 3D world is inherently a lossy process, i.e. the entire geometric richness of 3D gets projected onto a single flat 2D image. We aim to create an API in Python which primarily reconstructs 3D volumes from 2D X-Ray Images.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>We see this  project as the first step towards a diagnostic tool in conditions where either no CT equipment or the education to interpret x-ray imagery is available, such as for mobile x-ray devices, lay users, or medical diagnostics in developing countries. The project is primarily divided into 2 parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Implementation of various CNN architectures for 3D reconstruction from 2D images(3 people would be working on this part)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development of API(back-end framework for the above task).1 mentee would be working on this part.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--break-->

<p>Part 1 has some hard pre-requisites while anyone who has an interest in python or has done some basic programming in python or java-script can apply for part 2.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Pre-requisites for part 1: Must be familiar with any one of the following deep learning frameworks: Pytorch/Tensorflow/Theano/Keras.  A basic idea of neural networks and machine learning is required. Previous experience in image processing is desired although is not a hard pre-requisite.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Interested people in this part should go through the following <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04867.pdf">paper</a> while applying:</p>

<p>Note: If you are new to deep learning, it is recommended that you should go through the first 5 chapters of the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33986067-deep-learning-with-python">book</a> before applying:</p>
