<p>Rubik’s cube is one of the most fascinating 3-D combination puzzles we encounter. It is simple to understand the game, given a permutation we need to reduce the cube to a single goal state by rotating it. In this project, we will accomplish solving this cube with as minimum rotations as possible using the ideas of reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>There will be three modules that need to be completed.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Given the details about the faces of the cube, solve the puzzle in the back-end.</li>
  <li>Given an image, extract the details about the faces of the cube using various image processing and possibly ML techniques</li>
  <li>Develop an user interface for the above solution.</li>
</ol>
