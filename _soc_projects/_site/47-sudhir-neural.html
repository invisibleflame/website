<p>Implementing mesh neural network for 3D shape representation.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>The project will be an implementation of the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11424">MeshNet: Mesh Neural Network for 3D Shape Representation</a> (AAAI 2019). 
Mesh is an important and powerful type of data for 3D shapes and widely studied in the field of computer vision and computer graphics. A lot of research is going on to improve the accuracy of the 3D model classification. This paper has achieved 91.9% accuracy. You are expected to implement this research paper. The additional work may include modifying the NN Architecture and train the model on additional datasets.</p>

<p>The following points must be included in the proposal for the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your motivation and understanding of the project</li>
<li>Background in ML/DL (include your previous projects)</li>
<li>Experience with Python and libraries (Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc)</li>
</ul>
