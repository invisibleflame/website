<p>This project aims at introducing the student to the world of software development and graphic design. We will present several tools such as Android Studio, Googleâ€™s Firebase, Django, Adobe Xd, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Pro. After completing the basics, we will apply the learned concepts to build and design an ergonomic music app.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>The project has three parts: The interface will be developed using android studio / Flutter ,this will be the part of the app that the user interacts with. The back-end will be developed using Firebase / Django , this will be a server that stores the music and take care of authentication etc. The interface and logo of the app will be designed using Adobe Xd and Adobe Illustrator. Some animated video will be added using Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Our major aim for the SOC is for our mentees  to explore the fields of design and development and therefore, there are no hard prerequisites. We will start from the very basic. All that is required is an interest in design or coding and enthusiasm to work.</p>
