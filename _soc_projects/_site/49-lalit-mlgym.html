<p>The project is about making a web platform where a user can upload the data, choose any model according to which they want their data to be trained and see the results. In the first phase, we will make a platform where every parameter is given by the user. After successfully completing this, we will add a feature to suggest the best method and parameters for the data. In the final stage, the platform will have features for uploading raw data and getting results after pre-processing. Pre req: Grip over linear algebra</p>

<p>Every week, the mentees will be given to learn, analyze and work on a specific algorithm and explore how variation of parameters can vary the results for that.</p>
