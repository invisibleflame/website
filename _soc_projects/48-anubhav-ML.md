Implement your own sequence neural net

<!--break-->
Ever dreamed of making the compression algorithm from Pied Piper featured in the popular Silicon Valley series? Here is your chance! The project aims at implementing a potentially lossless algorithm which, unlike others, can work even on high entropy data. The project will involve basic knowledge of Discrete Time Fourier Transform, signal processing. However, a major portion would involve developing expertise in neural networks with focus on RNNs, LSTMs, etc. You would implement your own sequence to sequence neural net aimed at performing a particular task which is essential to the working of compression algorithm.

|Week Number  | Tasks to be Completed|
|--- | --- | 
|**Week 1,2,3** | Developing fundamentals in python,machine learning and neural networks through popular sources like coursera, udacity.|
|**Week 4,5** |Learning basics of RNNs and LSTMs and their in-depth implementation in tensorflow  2.0|
|**Week 6,7** |Trying out various models and getting your hands dirty while aiming to achieve the objective|
|**Week 8,9** | If above task is complete, packaging everything into an end-to-end pipeline |
