This project focuses on building a Decentralised Application (DApp) for registering land and using it as collateral for transactions. Being on the blockchain, all the registrations would be publicly verifiable and disputes could be settled with ease.

<!--break-->

In countries like India where the land records are maintained with human intervention are perennially marred with presumption and excessive bureaucracy,  leading to legal disputes.  Land is a precious asset that can be used as a collateral or used for many other productive purposes only if the title deeds are indisputable and are derived using a transparent process. 

<!--break-->

This project would help mentees understand the working of Blockchains (Ethereum in specific), and tools/frameworks used for Ethereum development such as Truffle, Ganache, Web3, Solidity and frontend development using React and Javascript. Mentees would be provided with enough reading material and hands-on practise on Smart Contract Development before actually working on  the project. They are expected to understand the mechanics of Ethereum and work on the frontend of the DApp, while also suggesting improvements to the existing smart contracts during the course of the project.

<!--break-->

To apply for the project, draft a short proposal mentioning clearly your familiarity with Coding (need not be Blockchain in specific). Also mention your Github handles in the proposal.

### Tentative Timeline:

|Week | Work |
|--- | --- |
| Week 1-2 | Read resources provided by us on Blockchain Dev, Ethereum and Land Registration to understand what you will be building. Also complete the Smart Contract Development training on CryptoZombies. |
| Week 3-4 | Familiarise with tools and services like Truffle, Ganache, IPFS, Metamask, Remix and Ethereum Testnets and understand the Smart Contracts for the DApp |
| Week 4-7 | Build the frontend for the DApp and suggest improvements to the existing smart contracts. |
| Week 8 and later | Search for bugs in the application and fix them; Try to improve the UI/UX (User Interface/User Experience) of the DApp |
