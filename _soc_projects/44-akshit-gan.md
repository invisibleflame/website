Yann LeCun described GANs as “the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in Machine Learning”. And, indeed, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs for short) have had a huge success since they were introduced in 2014 by Ian J. Goodfellow.

This project will involve learning many machine learning algorithms leading to GANs. Mentees will implement a Generative Adversarial Network from scratch.

For students who have participated in Summer of Science (Machine Learning track) before, this would be a great hands-on project!

### Tentative Timeline:

|Week | Work |
|--- | --- |
| Week 1-2 | Learn/Brush-up Python, Torch, Jupyter, Numpy, Unix commands|
| Week 3-4 | Learn Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks|
| Week 5-6 | Read up on the use cases and building blocks of Deep Learning.|
| Week 7-8 | Implement a generative adversarial network from scratch and train it on toy dataset.|
| Week 9-10 | Learn PyTorch/TensorFlow, implement a GAN network using the library.|
| Week 11-12 | Start collecting data and training. Document all interesting observations|
