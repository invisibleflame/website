I'm planning to create a game that simulates a real-life situation, similar to those strategic games done by the finance club, IITB. What needs to be done is that we need to create a game using Django so that multiple students are able to play it in real-time. The student will learn OOPs concepts and Web Development through this project. He/she needs to learn FrontEnd Technologies (Html, CSS, JS, JQuery) to design an attractive interface for the players to play the game, Backend( Django), OOP in Python.

- You are free to write a proposal based on your understanding of what the project could be and why do you want to contribute to this project (important). Any other ideas that can shape and steer the project are welcomed.
Use youtube to learn python and frontend. For Django, You can refer to the django documentation found on its official website after studying it from youtube.
