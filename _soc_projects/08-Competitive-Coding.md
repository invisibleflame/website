This project is mostly aimed towards people who want to excel in the sport of competitive programming. The agenda during the summers would be to get people acquainted with standard data structures and algorithms. Apart from this the project would require the mentees to give substantial time to practice problems on various online judges like Codeforces, Codechef, SPOJ etc.

<!--break-->

### Proposal:

 Mention your familiarity with C++ and algorithms in the proposal. Also if you already practice on some online judge like codechef, codeforces, hackerearth, do provide the link to your profile on those judges. If active on GitHub, provide link for that too. Also mention what other activities you are taking up in the summer and how much time you will be able to devote per week for SOC.

### Timeline: 

* week 1 :- C++ revision and STL
* week 2 :- Sorting, binary search
* week 3 :- greedy algorithms, exchange arguments
* week 4 :- binary exponentiation, sieve, modular arithmetic, Fermat's theorem
* week 5 :- Dynamic programming(basic)
* week 6 :- Dynamic programming(advanced)
* week 7 :- graph representation, BFS, DFS
* week 8 :- Dijkstra's algorithm
